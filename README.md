• Sarah is a freelance designer who works in website design. She would love to expand her network within the tech industry but is unsure of where or how to start. 

• Alex is currently learning to code online in his spare time. He is struggling with databases and would like help from a mentor to learn more about it one on one.

• Javascript Developer - Alicia is a mid-level Javascript developer who has a few years experience working for a start-up. She currently works 3 days a week and loves the idea of supplementing her income by teaching code. She isn't a qualified teacher but has amazing skills in the area of Javascript. She would love to improve her communication and managing skills to help her move up in her own career.
